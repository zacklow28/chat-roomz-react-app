# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple chat app built with React and Socket.io. It is hosted at [zacklow28chatroomz](https://zacklow28chatroomz.netlify.app/).
You can join a room and chat with other users in the same room. It also supports emojis by using the format `:emoji:` e.g. `:smile:`. It also
has a simple backend to allow realtime communication between users.
